Quick Classification problem using book reviews (10,000). 
In this I went through:
- Classes
- Functions
- Reading json file and storing it in an array
- Preparing data using train_test_split using sklearn
- Using bag of words to collect word count 
- Used different classifiers to make predictions such as SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression
- Tested f1 score for accuracy
- Used GridSearchCV to push for higher accuracy with different kernels and C values
- Saving the model for efficiency
